%% bip results
We evaluated \biptool{} against two industrial benchmarks, 
an {\em Automatic Teller Machine} (ATM)~\cite{atm} and the {\em Quorum} consensus
protocol~\cite{guerraoui2012speculative}. We report on the size of the generated
AIGs before and after reduction, and on the time taken by the ABC solver to 
reduce and verify the benchmarks. We compare the results for the 
verification of the ATM benchmark
with the NuSMV~\cite{nusmv} model checker.
