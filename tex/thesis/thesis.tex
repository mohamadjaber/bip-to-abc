%It is critical for software and hardware developers to design 
%correct and reliable systems. In particular, safety critical 
%systems such as medical equipment, navigation control and 
%targeting devices do not tolerate defects in the their logical 
%components. 
%Static analysis techniques are used to check and prove correctness 
%of logic components with respect to formal specifications. 
%In particular, ABC is a model checker that takes an And-Inverter-Graph (AIG) circuit,
%a directed acyclic graph with two input AND gates, inverters and 
%memory elements, 
%reduces it using synthesis algorithms, and checks it for correctness
%using proof algorithms. 
%%At a higher level, 
%Existing techniques transform software programs
%and embedded system design components into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
%formulae and Symbolic Model Verifier (SMV)
%%\todo{what is SMV?} 
%code, and use satisfiability (SAT) solvers and symbolic
%model checkers, respectively, to check their validity 
%within a user specified finite domain.
%These techniques often fail to scale well with 
%the increasing size of systems and with larger finite domains. 
%
%In this work, we explore the use of AIG solvers to 
%address the verification of software and embedded systems
%subject to bounds on the data width of their variables.
%\mytool{} translates imperative logic systems, written in a C-like language,
%into AIG. 
%\biptool{} translates an embedded system, written within the Behaviour-Interaction-Priority (BIP) framework,
%into AIG. 
%Both methods use the ABC AIG solver to reduce the generated AIG circuits using 
%sequential synthesis algorithms, and then check them for validity. 
%The solver either (1) proves the specifications valid within the finite domain, 
%(2) generates a counter example and reports it to the developer for debugging,
%or (3) reaches its computational bounds before making a decision. 
%%\todo{Statements on how the system was evaluated and snapshot of the results. }
%We evaluated \mytool{} against a set of array and list manipulation algorithms, 
%and various benchmarks obtained from the second competition on software verification 
%(SVComp'13). Results show that \mytool{} reaches bounds higher than those possible 
%with the CBMC bounded model checker. It was also able to rank amongst the top three
%tools in the software verification competition.
%%
%We also evaluated \biptool{} against two benchmarks, an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) system 
%and the Quorum consensus protocol. 
%\biptool{} surpasses the NuSMV model checker on both designs. 
%%
%%  Safety critical systems such as medical equipment, navigation control and tar-
%%getting devices rely on logical units such as software and hardware programs to
%%provide accurate services. Therefore it is critical for software and hardware
%%developers to design correct and reliable systems. 
%%Static analysis techniques are ones of the most used 
%%techniques to achieve such a goal. In this work, we proposal \mytool{}, a tool
%%set that consists an imperative language front end that accepts first order logic
%%specifications, and translates such design with their specifications into sequential 
%%circuits encoded as and inverter graphs (AIGs). This allows for an efficient and 
%%succinct representation of the designs in hand, in addition to the ability to perform several 
%%abstraction and optimizations. Additionally, we propose a technique to translate Behaviour
%%Interaction Priority (BIP) systems into imperative programs composed of wire and variable 
%%declarations, initialization and update steps. 
%%The synthesized programs are passed to \mytool{} for efficient sequential synthesis and 
%%verification. 
%%we propose a novel technique for synthesizing 
%%deterministic finite state automaton (DFA) from SERE specifications. The number of states
%%in the generated DFAs is linear in the number of propositions in the formula, and the DFAs
%%use auxiliary variables to encode non-determinism. The tool will also be equipped with a
%%command line interface and a debugger.
