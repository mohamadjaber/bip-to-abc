The grammar in Table~\ref{t:gr} describes \this components. 
A \this component starts with a list of declarations of 
wire,  register variables, and arrays of them. 

Then wires are defined in a list of assignment statements. 
Each wire can be the target of at most on assignment statement. 
If a wire is not assigned then it is a {\em primary input}. 

The \cci{init} list of statements assign initial values for 
the register variables. 
All the assignment statements within \cci{init} execute
simultaneously as indicated with the \cci{do\_together} keyword.

Similarly, the \cci{next} list of statements update the values 
of the register variables. 
All the assignment statements within \cci{next} execute 
simultaneously as indicated with the \cci{do\_together} keyword.

Each assignment statement has a left hand side target term 
which is either a variable or an access operator to an 
array element. 
The right hand side of an assignment is a combinational expression
with Boolean and arithmetic operators and a ternary choice 
operator. The ternary choice \cci{(a? b : c)} returns $b$ if $a$ 
is \true and $c$ otherwise. 

The translation of an \this component into a sequential circuit 
proceeds as follows. 
For each register variable in the component instantiate a 
vector of bit registers.
