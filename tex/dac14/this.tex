\section{\caig components}
\label{s:this}
A \caig program ranges over boolean, integer and array variables. 
A variable can be either a register denoting a memory element or a wire denoting a functional macro.
The \caig program starts with the variable declarations followed by the wire variable definitions. 
Then memory variables are initialized simultaneously using the \cci{do-together} construct. 
After initialization, an infinite loop updates the value of the memory variables simultaneously. 

The listings in Figure \ref{fig:gr} shows the syntax of a \caig program. 

The wires are defined in a list of assignment statements. 
Each wire can be the target of at most one assignment statement. 
If a wire is not assigned then it is a non-deterministic {\em primary input}. 

The list of statements \cci{init-list} assigns initial values to 
the register variables. All the assignment statements within \cci{init-list} execute
simultaneously as indicated with the \cci{do-together} construct.

Similarly, the \cci{next-list} list of statements updates the values 
of the register variables. 
%All the assignment statements within \cci{next-list} execute simultaneously as indicated with the \cci{do-together} keyword.

Each assignment statement has a left hand side target term 
which is either a variable or an access operator to an 
array element. 
The right hand side of an assignment is a combinational expression ranging over the program variables,  Boolean and arithmetic operators, and a ternary choice 
operator. The ternary choice \cci{(a? b : c)} returns $b$ if $a$ 
is \true and $c$ otherwise.
