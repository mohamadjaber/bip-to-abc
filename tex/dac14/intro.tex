In recent years, embedded systems have witnessed a large 
expansion, especially with  the emergence of automotive 
electronics, mobile and control devices.
An embedded system is a composition of heterogeneous 
intellectual property (IP) components.
Figure~\ref{fig:flow} shows a typical flow of this composition where the
components are specified as imperative programs, finite state machines (FSM), labeled 
transition systems (LTS), data flow networks, and discrete event based circuits. 
Computations in embedded systems are subject to several 
physical and architectural 
constraints that render the separation between software and 
hardware design impractical~\cite{henzinger2006embedded}.
The partitioning task, often done manually, decides whether a component is to 
be implemented as a programmed process or as a realtime logic circuit. 
A plethora of software, behavioral, and logic compilation and synthesis techniques are
used in the process\cite{Metropolis1}.

%The design of embedded systems involves
%{\em Component-based systems} design 
%and control devices
%Furthermore, {\em component-based system} (CBS) design is gaining more prominence 
%after the widespread of embedded systems, especially for mobile and control devices. 
The Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) framework 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Double check this todo note %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\todo{lots of grammatical errors. plz check thoroughly. plural vs singular, missing noun between a sequence of qualitative adjectives/adverbs and the verbs, parallel structures}
is a {\em Component-Based System} (CBS) design framework that uses a dedicated 
language and tool-set to support a rigorous and layered design flow for embedded 
systems.  
%\todo{the introduction sentence of BIP is weak and obviously a sales statement repeating design several times.}
BIP allows to build complex systems by coordinating the behavior of a set of 
atomic components~\cite{BasuBBCJNS11}.
BIP makes use of (1) the DFinder~\cite{dfinder} compositional  
and incremental verification tool-set, and (2) the NuSMV~\cite{nusmv} model checker, 
to check the correctness of BIP systems. 
However, DFinder \cite{BBL14} does not handle data transfer between components, 
and it does not support checking for invariants other than deadlock freedom. 
Additionally, for complex systems, NuSMV often suffers from the state space explosion 
problem~\cite{sipser2006introduction}, and fails to perform its verification tasks.

ABC~\cite{brayton2010abc} is a transformation-based 
verification (TBV)~\cite{kuehlmann2001transformation} framework that operates on 
And-Inverter Graphs (AIG); semi-canonical Boolean netlists with
memory elements, and iteratively and synergistically 
employs powerful reduction, abstraction and decision algorithms such as 
retiming~\cite{KuBa01}, 
redundancy removal~\cite{HmBPK05,KuMP01,BjesseC00,aziz-fmsd-00}, 
logic rewriting~\cite{BjBo04}, interpolation~\cite{McMillan03}, 
and localization~\cite{Wang03}, 
symbolic model checking, bounded model checking, induction, 
interpolation, circuit SAT solving, 
and target enlargement~\cite{MoGS00,MoMZ01,HoSH00,BaKuAb02,Hari05expert}.

In this paper, we present a method and a supporting tool (\biptool)
for embedded system synthesis, runtime verification,
and model checking with a cycle based execution model.
The method leverages transformation-based synthesis and verification techniques 
as follows. 
%\biptool~ that takes a BIP system and a set of 
%specifications amd
%properties and generates the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The method takes a BIP system and a set of invariants and generates 
  an AIG circuit with an output therein that is $\mathit{true}$ iff the system 
  is deadlock free, and satisfies the system invariants. 
  The method passes the generated AIG circuit to ABC for verification. 
  ABC either proves correctness or produces a counter example where the 
  system violates an invariant. 
  This enabled us to find defects and prove systems that were not 
  possible using DFinder and NuSMV. 
\item  The supporting tool \biptool~ provides a debugging mechanism where the 
  counter example is mapped back to the original BIP system. 
  The debugging tool is integrated with a wave form visualization tool \cite{bybell2010gtkwave}.  
\item The method generates an FPGA implementation of the BIP system with a 
  system-specific execution framework. 
  The FPGA implementation is passed to ABC synthesis reduction algorithms 
  which reduce the area and the critical time of the FPGA implementation 
  by removing latches and logic gates. 
  To the best our knowledge, we are the first to synthesize a BIP system directly 
  into an FPGA. 
\item The method generates a concurrent C implementation that simulates the BIP 
  system with a system-specific execution framework. 
\end{enumerate}


BIP uses a runtime engine to simulate its execution semantic. 
The main loop of the engine consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each atomic component sends to the engine its current location.
\item The engine enumerates on the list of interactions in the model, selects the enabled ones based on the current location of the atomic components and eliminates the ones with low priority.
\item The engine non-deterministically selects an interaction out of the enabled interactions.
\item Finally, the engine notifies the corresponding components and schedule their transitions for execution. 
\end{enumerate}
We differ in that, the system specific scheduler is a bit vector of interactions directly embedded in the implementation. The interaction bit vector evaluates in real-time 
and directly depends on the locations and the values of the variables of the input system. The system specific execution framework empirically reduces the space and time requirements for running the C simulation and FPGA execution. 

Metropolis takes a Metropolis Meta Model (MMM) description of an embedded system and 
generates a SystemC based simulator of the system. It has also a path to 
SIS~\cite{SISSynthesis} which is a synthesis predecessor tool of ABC, and a path 
to NuSMV for model checking.
