In recent years, {\em embedded systems} have witnessed a large 
expansion, especially with  the emergence of automotive 
electronics, mobile and control devices.
An embedded system is a composition of {\em heterogeneous}
intellectual property (IP) components.
Figure~\ref{fig:flow} shows a typical flow of the composition process where the
components are specified as imperative programs, finite state machines (FSM), labeled 
transition systems (LTS), data flow networks, and discrete event based circuits. 
Computations in embedded systems are subject to several 
physical and architectural 
constraints that render the separation between software and 
hardware design impractical~\cite{henzinger2006embedded}.
The partitioning task, often done manually, decides whether a component is to 
be implemented as a programmed process or as a realtime logic circuit. 
A plethora of software, behavioral, and logic compilation and synthesis techniques are
used in the process~\cite{metropolis2}.


%The design of embedded systems involves
%{\em Component-based systems} design 
%and control devices
%Furthermore, {\em component-based system} (CBS) design is gaining more prominence 
%after the widespread of embedded systems, especially for mobile and control devices. 
The Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) framework 
is a {\em Component-Based System} (CBS) design framework that uses a dedicated 
language and tool-set to support a rigorous and layered design flow for embedded 
systems.  
BIP allows to build complex systems by coordinating the behavior of a set of 
atomic components~\cite{bip11}.
BIP makes use of (1) the DFinder~\cite{dfinder} compositional  
and incremental verification tool-set, and (2) the NuSMV~\cite{nusmv} model checker, 
to check the correctness of BIP systems. 
However, DFinder \cite{BBL14} does not handle data transfer between components, 
and it does not support checking for invariants other than deadlock freedom. 
Additionally, for complex systems, NuSMV often suffers from the state space explosion 
problem~\cite{sipser2006introduction}, and fails to perform its verification tasks.

ABC~\cite{brayton2010abc} is a transformation-based 
verification (TBV)~\cite{KuBa01} framework that operates on 
And-Inverter Graphs (AIG); semi-canonical Boolean netlists with
memory elements. It employs iteratively and synergistically: (1) powerful reduction, (2) abstraction, and (3) decision algorithms; such as
retiming~\cite{KuBa01}, 
redundancy removal~\cite{HmBPK05,KuMP01,BjesseC00,aziz-fmsd-00}, 
logic rewriting~\cite{BjBo04}, interpolation~\cite{McMillan03}, 
and localization~\cite{Wang03}, 
symbolic model checking, bounded model checking, induction, 
interpolation, circuit SAT solving, 
and target enlargement~\cite{MoGS00,MoMZ01,HoSH00,BaKuAb02,Hari05expert}.

In this paper, we present a method and a supporting tool (\biptool)
for embedded system synthesis, runtime verification,
and model checking with a cycle based execution model.
The method leverages transformation-based synthesis and verification techniques 
as follows. 
%\biptool~ that takes a BIP system and a set of 
%specifications amd
%properties and generates the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The method takes a BIP system and a set of invariants and generates 
  an AIG circuit with an output therein that is \true iff the system 
  is deadlock free, and satisfies the system invariants. 
  The method passes the generated AIG circuit to ABC for verification. 
  ABC either proves correctness or produces a counter example where the 
  system violates an invariant. 
  This enabled us to find defects and prove systems that were not 
  possible using DFinder and NuSMV. 
\item  The supporting tool \biptool~ provides a debugging mechanism where the 
  counter example is mapped back to the original BIP system. 
  The debugging tool is integrated with a wave form visualization tool \cite{bybell2010gtkwave}.  
\item The method generates an FPGA implementation of the BIP system with a 
  system-specific execution framework. 
  The FPGA implementation is passed to ABC synthesis reduction algorithms 
  which reduce the area and the critical time of the FPGA implementation 
  by removing latches and logic gates. 
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to synthesize a BIP system directly 
  into an FPGA. 
\item The method generates a concurrent C implementation that simulates the BIP 
  system with a system-specific execution framework. 
\end{enumerate}


BIP uses a runtime engine to simulate its execution semantic. 
The main loop of the engine consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each atomic component sends to the engine its current location.
\item The engine enumerates the list of interactions in the system, 
  selects the enabled ones based on the current location of the atomic 
  components and eliminates the ones with low priority.
\item The engine non-deterministically selects an interaction out of the enabled interactions.
\item Finally, the engine notifies the corresponding components and schedule their transitions for execution. 
\end{enumerate}
We differ in that, the system specific scheduler is a bit vector of interactions directly embedded in the implementation. 
The interaction bit vector evaluates in real-time and directly depends on the locations and the values of the variables of the input system. 
The system specific execution framework empirically reduces the space and time requirements for the C simulation and the FPGA execution. 

Several frameworks for the design and verification of embedded systems exist. 
We briefly introduce them here and discuss and compare to them later in 
Section~\ref{sec:related}.
Metropolis~\cite{metropolis1,metropolis2} is a design framework that
takes a Metropolis Meta Model (MMM) description of an embedded system 
and generates a SystemC~\cite{systemc} based simulator of the system.
It has also a path to SIS~\cite{brayton92sis} which is a synthesis predecessor tool 
of ABC, and a path to SPIN for model checking~\cite{HolzSpin97}. 
SystemC~\cite{systemc} in turn is a design framework based on C++ that allows
system components to communicate through ports, interfaces, and channels.
Extensions to SystemC such as ForSyDe~\cite{SanderJ04} restrict the 
expressiveness to enable formal verification tools to handle the system. 
In brief, our method supports the synthesis, model checking, and runtime verification 
concerns of embedded systems using tool independent semantics across the three concerns
by embedding the execution model of the embedded system in the generated systems 
for each concern. 
This allows for simple debugging and design flow cycle iterations. Furthermore, 
the use of AIG circuits for synthesis and model checking allows our method to leverage
the mature and rich literature of logic synthesis techniques. 

%% organization
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:bip}, we recall the necessary concepts of the BIP framework. Section \ref{sec:this} defines one loop program (\caig). Section \ref{sec:sequential} formalizes sequential circuit and shows how to translate a sequential circuit into \caig. Section \ref{sec:bip2aig} shows how to translate a BIP system into \caig. Section \ref{sec:implem}
describes \biptool{}, a full implementation of our framework and some benchmarks. Section \ref{sec:related} discusses related work. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} draws some conclusions and perspectives.
