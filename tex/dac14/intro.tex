\section{Introduction}
\label{sect-intro}

\begin{itemize}
\item High-level modeling 
\item correct-by-construction
\item model checking. verification. DFinder does not support data transfer. 
\item Automatic generation of synthesizable code  (FPGA, ...).
\item Generated code includes an execution engine that is already customized for the system at hand (ASIC like)
\item Runtime verification (simulation) -- faster than existing for the same reason above
\item related work (VHDL, SystemC, etc.).
\end{itemize}
