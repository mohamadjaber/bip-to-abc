\begin{abstract}
Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) is a layered embedded 
system design and verification framework that provides 
separation of 
functionality, synchronization, and priority concerns to 
simplify system design and to establish correctness by 
construction. 
The framework comes with a runtime engine and a suite
of verification tools that uses D-Finder and NuSMV as 
model checkers. 
In this paper we provide a method and a supporting tool
that takes a BIP system and a set of invariants
and computes a reduced sequential circuit with a 
system-specific scheduler and with a designated output that 
is \true when the invariants hold. 
Our method uses ABC, a sequential circuit synthesis and 
verification framework to 
(1) generate an efficient circuit implementation of the system that can be 
readily translated into FPGA or ASIC implementations, 
and to (2) verify the system and debug it in case a 
counterexample was found. 
Moreover we generate a concurrent C implementation of the circuit that
can be directly used for runtime verification.
We evaluated our method with two benchmark systems, and our results
show that our method is faster and scales to sizes larger than possible with 
existing techniques.
