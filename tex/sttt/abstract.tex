\begin{abstract}
Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) is a layered embedded 
system design and verification framework that provides 
separation of 
functionality, synchronization, and priority concerns to 
simplify system design and to establish correctness by 
construction. 
The framework comes with a runtime engine and a suite
of verification tools that use D-Finder and NuSMV as 
model checkers. 

In this paper, we provide a method and a supporting tool
that take a BIP system and a set of invariants
and compute a reduced sequential circuit with a 
system-specific scheduler and a designated output that 
is \true when the invariants hold. 
Our method uses ABC, a sequential circuit synthesis and 
verification framework, to 
(1) generate an efficient circuit implementation of the system that can be 
readily translated into FPGA or ASIC implementations, 
and to (2) verify the system and debug it in case a 
counterexample is found. 
Moreover, we generate a concurrent C implementation of the circuit that
can be directly used for runtime verification.
We evaluated our method with two benchmark systems, and our results
show that, compared to existing techniques, our method is faster and scales to larger sizes.
