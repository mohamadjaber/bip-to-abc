This paper presents a decent report on rather complex approach to support the
development of the so called BIP (Behavior-Interaction-Priority) systems. The
support includes both the generation of efficient circuit implementation for
FPGA or ASIC platform, and verification of deadlock freedom using a model checker.

I think the contribution is reasonable within the scope of the journal, text of
the paper is well written and mature enough. Since I had no problems to follow
the technicalities, I am happy to recommend acceptance.
