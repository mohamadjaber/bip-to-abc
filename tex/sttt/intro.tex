{\em Embedded systems} have witnessed a large 
expansion, especially with  the emergence of automotive 
electronics, mobile and control devices.
%
An embedded system is a composition of intellectual property (IP) components
of {\em heterogeneous} computational nature, i.e. some might be implemented as software 
processor executables while some might be implemented as real time logic circuits. 
{\em Field-programmable gate array} (FPGA) logic circuits are popular logic circuit 
implementations of 
embedded system components because they are amenable for reconfiguration. 
%
Figure~\ref{fig:flow} shows a typical flow of the composition process where the
components are specified as imperative programs, finite state machines (FSM), labeled 
transition systems (LTS), data flow networks, and discrete-event based circuits~\cite{henzinger2006embedded}.
%Computations in embedded systems are subject to several 
%physical and architectural 
%constraints that render the separation between software and 
%hardware design impractical~\cite{henzinger2006embedded}.
Partitioning, often done manually, decides whether a component is to 
be implemented as a programmed process or as a real time logic circuit. 
A plethora of software, behavioral, and logic compilation and synthesis techniques are
used in the process~\cite{metropolis2}.
The end result implementation is then subject to functional verification including 
model checking and runtime verification. 

The design flow faces three important challenges of relevant to this paper. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The size and the critical depth of the FPGA implementation are critical factors that decide how many IPs can 
    be loaded on the same FPGA board, and how fast the board can be clocked, respectively. 
    Synthesis techniques that reduce both size and depth are needed. 
  \item Model checking often faces the state space explosion problem which renders the results of model checking inconclusive. 
    Techniques that allow model checking to scale to larger systems are needed. 
  \item Runtime verification with heavy simulation engines take long time to complete runtime verification tasks. 
    Faster techniques are needed. 
\end{itemize}

%The design of embedded systems involves
%{\em Component-based systems} design 
%and control devices
%Furthermore, {\em component-based system} (CBS) design is gaining more prominence 
%after the widespread of embedded systems, especially for mobile and control devices. 
The Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) is a framework for the design of 
{\em Component-Based Systems} (CBS). 
It uses a dedicated language and tool-set to support a rigorous 
and layered design flow for embedded systems. 
BIP is currently being used in academy and in industry in projects such as 
ASCENS, COMBEST, PRO3D, SMECY, ACROSS, MARAE, GOAC, MIND and CHAPI \cite{bipwebsite}. 
BIP allows to build complex systems by coordinating the behavior of a set of 
atomic components~\cite{bip11}.
BIP makes use of (1) the DFinder~\cite{dfinder} compositional  
and incremental verification tool-set, and (2) the NuSMV~\cite{nusmv} model checker, 
to check the correctness of BIP systems. 
However, DFinder \cite{BBL14} does not handle data transfer between components, 
and it supports only the verification of deadlock-freedom. 
Additionally, for complex systems, NuSMV often suffers from the state space explosion 
problem~\cite{sipser2006introduction}, and fails to perform its verification tasks.

ABC~\cite{brayton2010abc} is a transformation-based 
verification (TBV)~\cite{KuBa01} framework that operates on 
And-Inverter Graphs (AIG); semi-canonical Boolean netlists with
memory elements. It employs iteratively and synergistically: (1) powerful reduction, (2) abstraction, and (3) decision algorithms; such as
retiming~\cite{KuBa01}, 
redundancy removal~\cite{HmBPK05,KuMP01,BjesseC00,aziz-fmsd-00}, 
logic rewriting~\cite{BjBo04}, interpolation~\cite{McMillan03}, 
and localization~\cite{Wang03}, 
symbolic model checking, bounded model checking, induction, 
interpolation, circuit SAT solving, 
and target enlargement~\cite{MoGS00,MoMZ01,HoSH00,BaKuAb02,Hari05expert}.

In this paper, we present a method and a supporting tool (\biptool)
for embedded system synthesis, runtime verification,
and model checking with a cycle-based execution model.
The method leverages transformation-based synthesis and verification techniques 
as follows. 
%\biptool~ that takes a BIP system and a set of 
%specifications amd
%properties and generates the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The method takes a BIP system and a set of invariants and generates 
  an intermediate C-like {\em one loop program } \caig. 
  The \caig step is necessary to allow for runtime verification and for the use
  of ABC verification algorithms. We consider invariant properties which are Boolean expressions
over atomic propositions. Atomic propositions express conditions
on components (e.g., current locations, values of variables).

\item The method then translates the \caig program to 
  an AIG circuit with an output therein that is \true iff the system 
  is deadlock free, and satisfies the system invariants. 
  The method passes the generated AIG circuit to ABC for reduction and 
  verification. 
  The method drives the ABC reduction and verification algorithms and 
  either proves correctness or produces a counter example where the 
  system violates an invariant. 
  This enabled us to find defects and prove systems that were not 
  possible using DFinder and NuSMV. 

\item  \biptool~ provides a debugging mechanism where the 
  counter example is mapped back to the original BIP system. 
  The debugging tool is integrated with a wave form visualization tool 
  \cite{bybell2010gtkwave}.  
\item The method generates a {\em field-programmable gate array} (FPGA) 
  implementation of the BIP system with a 
  system-specific execution framework. 
  An FPGA implementation is a configuration of 
  memory elements and lookup-up tables (LUT) provided with an FPGA board
  that implements a specific logical function
  and appropriately performs the desired computation. 
  FPGA implementations are directly mapped to other integrated circuit representations
  such as {\em application specific integrated circuits} (ASIC). 
  FPGA implementations of computational tasks are desired with embedded 
  systems versus other logic circuit implementations 
  since an FPGA board can house several computational tasks at once,
  and can be automatically reconfigured to perform new computational tasks. 

  \biptool{} constructs the FPGA implementation from the reduced AIG circuit 
  to benefit from the area and critical time reduction algorithms 
  of the ABC framework. 
  The reduction algorithms remove redundant latches and logic gates.  
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to synthesize a BIP system directly 
  into an FPGA. 

\item The method translates the \caig program into a concurrent runtime verification 
  implementation that simulates the BIP 
  system with a system-specific execution framework. More precisely, runtime verification can be done using 
test case generation techniques of typical concurrent C-code \cite{kbse-BurnimS08}.
\end{enumerate}


BIP is based on the generation of modular code and a dedicated platfrom, BIP \emph{engine}, which simulates BIP semantic and orchestrates the computation of atomic components. This allows clarity of models but it results in great inefficiency. The main loop of the engine consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each atomic component sends to the engine its current location.
\item The engine enumerates the list of interactions in the system, 
  selects the enabled ones based on the current location of the atomic 
  components and eliminates the ones with low priority.
\item The engine non-deterministically selects an interaction out of the enabled interactions.
\item Finally, the engine notifies the corresponding components and schedule their transitions for execution. 
\end{enumerate}
Our method differs in that it directly embeds in the implementation a system specific scheduler represented by a bit vector of of interactions.
The interaction bit vector evaluates in real-time and directly depends on the locations and the values of the variables of the input system. 
The system specific execution framework empirically reduces the space and time requirements for the C simulation and the FPGA execution. 

%Several frameworks for the design and verification of embedded systems exist. 
%We briefly introduce them here and discuss and compare to them later in 
%Section~\ref{sec:related}.

Several frameworks for the design and verification of embedded systems exist 
(see Section~\ref{sec:related} for a detailed comparison with related work).
%
Metropolis~\cite{metropolis1,metropolis2} is a design framework that
takes a Metropolis Meta Model (MMM) description of an embedded system 
and generates a SystemC~\cite{systemc} based simulator of the system.
It has also a path to SIS~\cite{brayton92sis} which is a synthesis predecessor tool 
of ABC, and a path to SPIN for model checking~\cite{HolzSpin97}. 
SystemC~\cite{systemc} in turn is a design framework based on C++ that allows
system components to communicate through ports, interfaces, and channels.
Extensions to SystemC such as ForSyDe~\cite{SanderJ04} restrict the 
expressiveness to enable formal verification tools to handle the system. 
In brief, our method supports the synthesis, model checking, and runtime verification 
concerns of embedded systems using tool independent semantics across the three concerns
by embedding the execution model of the embedded system in the generated systems 
for each concern. 
This allows for simple debugging and design flow cycle iterations. Furthermore, 
the use of AIG circuits for synthesis and model checking allows our method to leverage
the mature and rich literature of logic synthesis techniques.
