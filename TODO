[DONE]
In the two cycle version we consider that the following case exists:
interaction a with action p1.x1 = p2.y1 ...
and there exists a transition labelled with the port p1 with action x1 = f(...), or x2 = x1 
That is, we need to execute the action on the interaction first then the action on the transition.

In the one cycle version (optimized) we assume that this situation does not appear. We can do a transformation of the model to avoid such a situation.
