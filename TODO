In the two cycle version we consider that the following case exists:
interaction a with action p1.x1 = p2.y1 ...
and there exists a transition labelled with the port p1 with action x1 = f(...). 
That is, we need to execute the action on the interaction first the the action on the transition.

However, this case barely appears in BIP. Note that, if the action on the transition is x2 = x1, it is OK. 

In the one cycle version we assume that if an action modifies a variable the transition will not modify that variable, which is not a big restriction, 
and that should be the case.
